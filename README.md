# Digit Recognizer Competition

# Overview

This project is based on Digit Recognizer competition, where the goal is to recognise digit by pixel characteristics

# Files

List and briefly describe the main files in your repository:

- Digit Recognizer (ML).ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the main analysis, modeling code and some statistic.

- Digit Recognizer (ML-Tensorflow).ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the main analysis, modeling code and visual statistic.

- train.csv: CSV file containing the training dataset.

- test.csv: CSV file containing the test dataset for making predictions.

- predictions.csv: CSV file containing the predictions for the test set.

# Dependencies

- Python 3

- pandas

- scikit-learn

# Usage

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/feed7362/Digit-Recognizer-ML.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Digit-Recognizer-ML
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Open and run the Digit Recognizer (ML).ipynb or Digit Recognizer (ML-Tensorflow).ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

# Approach

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering.

- Model selection: SVC, Tensorflow

- Model evaluation: Score, accuracy, loss.

# Results

Accuracy achieved on the test set.

- Kaggle accuracy:  0.98978

- Random accuracy from dataset: 0.9916
